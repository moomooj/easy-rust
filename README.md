# ðŸ¦€ Easy Rust

Welcome to **Easy Rust** â€” a personal Rust learning site.

This site serves as a public record of my journey learning the Rust programming language, based on the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

I'm currently studying Computer Science at **Douglas College**, and I created this space to organize, summarize, and share what Iâ€™ve learned.

Feel free to read, explore, and learn alongside me!
